\item\contentsline{section}{src/\mbox{\hyperlink{position__service_8cpp}{position\+\_\+service.\+cpp}} \\*The \mbox{\hyperlink{position__service_8cpp}{position\+\_\+service.\+cpp}} provides a server that generates random positions in x, y, theta coordinates. These informations are setted in a Random\+Position custom service message, that is shared between the position\+\_\+service\+\_\+component to the state\+\_\+machine\+\_\+component. Here the code is developed as a node component, by creating a class Random\+Server }{\pageref{position__service_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{src/\mbox{\hyperlink{state__machine_8cpp}{state\+\_\+machine.\+cpp}} \\*The state\+\_\+machine node is a sort of the \char`\"{}main\char`\"{} in the entire architecture\+: it is connected with all the other nodes (/user\+\_\+interface, /position\+\_\+server and /go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point). The scope of this node is to get the command from the /user\+\_\+interface node via the Command server custom message. If the command is equal to \char`\"{}start\char`\"{}, steate\+\_\+machine node sends a request to the /position\+\_\+server node in order to get a random position in a defined interval. This position will be used to set the parameters for the position to reach via a Position service custom message that is sent to /go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point node which will move the robot. Then there\textquotesingle{}s a loop in which this node verify that command is not \char`\"{}start\char`\"{} anymore, in this case it stops sending new target position to the robot. The code is developped as a R\+O\+S2 component in order to load it in a rt2\+\_\+assignment1 container }{\pageref{state__machine_8cpp}}{}
