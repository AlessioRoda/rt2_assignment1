\item\contentsline{section}{src/\mbox{\hyperlink{position__service_8cpp}{position\+\_\+service.\+cpp}} \\*This node has the purpose to generate a random postiion in terms of x, y and theta coordinates from a range that is defined in the /state\+\_\+machine. Once it has created, it sends it via Random\+Position custom service message to the /state\+\_\+machine node }{\pageref{position__service_8cpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{src/\mbox{\hyperlink{state__machine_8cpp}{state\+\_\+machine.\+cpp}} \\*The state\+\_\+machine node is a sort of the \char`\"{}main\char`\"{} in the entire architecture\+: it is connected with all the other nodes (/user\+\_\+interface, /position\+\_\+server and /go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point). The scope of this node is to get the command from the /user\+\_\+interface node via the Command server custom message. If the command is equal to \char`\"{}start\char`\"{}, steate\+\_\+machine node sends a request to the /position\+\_\+server node in order to get a random position in a defined interval. This position will be used to set the parameters for the action goal to reach, then the goal is sent to /go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point node which will move the robot. Then there\textquotesingle{}s a loop in which this node verify that command is not \char`\"{}start\char`\"{} anymore, in this case it cancels the goal in order to stop the robot }{\pageref{state__machine_8cpp}}{}
